Terminal: Alfred 2 Workflow
=======================

The “Open Terminal Here” action in Alfred 2 didn’t seem to work for me so I created my own.

Since then, two useful actions have been added:

* The “>” keyword will execute commands in a shell without opening the terminal and will print results back in a notification.
* “> Here” is a file action that opens the “>” action prompt but will use the current folder as cwd.
